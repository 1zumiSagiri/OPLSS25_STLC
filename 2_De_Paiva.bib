  abstract="We consider two systems of constructive modal logic which are computationally motivated. Their modalities admit several computational interpretations and are used to capture intensional features such as notions of computation, constraints, concurrency, etc. Both systems have so far been studied mainly from type-theoretic and category-theoretic perspectives, but Kripke models for similar systems were studied independently. Here we bring these threads together and prove duality results which show how to relate Kripke models to algebraic models and these in turn to the appropriate categorical models for these logics.",

	abstract = {We study Girard's linear logic from the point of view of giving a concrete computational interpretation of the logic, based on the Curry—Howard isomorphism. In the case of Intuitionistic linear logic, this leads to a refinement of the lambda calculus, giving finer control over order of evaluation and storage allocation, while maintaining the logical content of programs as proofs, and computation as cut-elimination. In the classical case, it leads to a concurrent process paradigm with an operational semantics in the style of Berry and Boudol's chemical abstract machine. This opens up a promising new approach to the parallel implementation of functional programming languages; and offers the prospect of typed concurrent programming in which correctness is guaranteed by the typing.},
